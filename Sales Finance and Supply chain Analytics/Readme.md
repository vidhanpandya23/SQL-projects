# Ad Hoc Insights - Finance And Supply Chain Analytics


## Project Overview:
Atliq Hardware, a leading global manufacturer in the consumer goods sector, specializing in computer peripherals, encountered significant challenges due to rapid business growth and the resultant increase in data volumes. Initially relying on Excel for database management, Atliq found itself struggling to cope with expanding datasets and the efficient management of multiple files. To address these issues, Atliq established a dedicated Data and Analytics team, which leveraged SQL solutions to effectively manage data.

The project encompasses a vast database comprising over 1 million records, serving as the cornerstone for Atliq's data management efforts.

### Challenges:
1. **Expanding Data Volumes** : Atliq faced difficulties in managing the exponential growth of data, leading to challenges in data storage, retrieval, and processing.

2. **Data Utilization for Decision-Making**: With increasing volumes of data, Atliq encountered hurdles in extracting actionable insights and making informed, data-driven decisions in a timely manner.

### Key Learnings:

1. **Advanced SQL Queries:** We mastered complex SQL queries, enabling us to efficiently extract and manipulate data.

2. **CTE (Common Table Expressions):** By using Common Table Expressions, we created temporary result sets, making our queries easier to understand and speeding up complex data operations.

3. **Stored Procedures:** Implementing stored procedures allowed us to reuse code, maintain it more easily, and enhance system security, leading to overall efficiency gains.

4. **Query Optimization:** We learned techniques to optimize our queries, making them run faster and improving database performance.

5. **Insertion and Modification in Database:** We developed strategies to insert and modify data efficiently, ensuring that our database remained reliable and consistent.

6. **Database Design Principles:** Emphasizing solid database design principles such as normalization and indexing helped us optimize data storage and retrieval.

7. **Understanding Datatypes:** A thorough understanding of SQL data types empowered us to model and manipulate data effectively, ensuring accuracy and compatibility.

8. **Data Integrity and Relationships:** We prioritized maintaining data integrity and establishing relationships between database entities, ensuring the reliability and consistency of our data.

9. **Window Functions:** Leveraging window functions enabled us to perform advanced data analysis tasks like ranking, aggregation, and partitioning, thereby enhancing our analytical capabilities.
